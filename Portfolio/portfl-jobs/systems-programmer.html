            <h2>Job description</h2>

            <p>
                This especific service was about a test of performance in an <strong> API integration </strong> using, at first, <strong>NodeJs</strong> and
                <strong>Express</strong> into a <strong>Docker</strong> Container. Those tests was necessary to know how many resouces would be necessary to use when production mode project. After that the project was integrated and tested using
                <strong>TypeScript</strong> with <strong>NestJS</strong>.
            </p>

                Considering the necessity of monitoring and keep tests working in a good mood, a study of tools and ways to monitoring it was started. Tools like <strong>Elasticsearch</strong> and <strong>Kibana</strong>,
                <strong>Prometheus</strong> and Grafana was analysed to pick the best choice. But, more than that, the necessity to monitoring over than an project emerged: monitoring everything.

                JavaScript, NodeJS, Prometheus <strong>(PromQL)</strong> and <strong>Grafana</strong> was the chosen tools to iniciate de montoriing project. At first, the server where services is running was monitored, after that, any container
                <strong>(service/microservice)</strong> into it. Metrics was collected and calculations using PromQL was adaptaded to the necessity of any service an its main functions. Services as <strong>RabbitMQ</strong>,
                <strong>Nginx</strong> and <strong>Docker</strong> was monitored and visual graphics created to good visualization. Prom-client (TypeScript & NodeJS) was chosen to extract metrics of the software.
